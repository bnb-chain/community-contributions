# BNB Chain Hackathon Wishlist 2025 H2

This document summarizes key focus areas for developers participating in a hackathon, viewed from the BNB Chain ecosystem perspective. The goal is to provide high-level guidance and highlight project types that align with the platform's strategic interests and community needs.

# I. Ecosystem Expansion & Utility

Projects should aim to enhance the BNB Chain ecosystem, focusing on real-world utility and user adoption.

| Key Area | Focus Points |
| :---: | :--- |
| **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) 2.0 with AI capacity** | **DeFi & AI Integration** Focus on building sophisticated DeFi protocols, such as: - Innovative lending and borrowing platforms. - Yield aggregation solutions. - User-friendly products that feel Web2 that integrate and hide crypto complexity - Structured financial products. Ideally integrate with AI capabilities, particularly for automation in areas like curator strategy review and portfolio management. |
| **Privacy Protection For BNBChain** | Solutions that enable users to make private transactions without compromising decentralization or permissionlessness. Key considerations for proposed solutions include: - **Affordability:** Leveraging the low cost of BNB Chain to make privacy protection more accessible. - **User Experience:** Providing a better user experience and native integration with existing wallets. - **Compliance:** Addressing compliance requirements, such as including a proof of innocence mechanism. |
| **Decentralized AI** | Projects should concentrate on AI innovations that enhance AI adoption and integrate with the decentralized AI ecosystem. This includes, but is not limited to, decentralized AI reputation systems, registration mechanisms, AI payments, and related infrastructure. - **Safe (with proper vaulting, TEE etc) Autonomous/Pro-active AI Trading Agents.** - **Best if agents are fed with data/ability to scrape data online, not just Model Wrappers.** |
| **Prediction Markets & Trading Infrastructure** | **Focus Points** - On-chain prediction protocols (binary, categorical, continuous) - UX improvements for retail speculation - Automated market making and payout logic |
| **Launchpads & Token Discovery** | Hackathon projects should prioritize innovative solutions in the following areas: - **Fair Token Distribution & Launch Mechanics:** Implement gamified approaches for token launches to ensure fair and broad distribution, coupled with transparent tokenomics and anti-bot measures for minting. - **Community Engagement & Governance:** Develop mechanisms for community voting, participation ladders, and quest systems to drive engagement. - **Discovery and Allocation:** Focus on social-driven discovery and ranking systems for new tokens. Utilize tools like leaderboards, voting escrow, and merit-based allocation methods. |
| **New frontiers** | We are looking for innovative projects focusing on governance, , and cutting-edge concepts like Futarchy, Neobanks, and payments. |
| **Web3 developer toolkit** | Projects should aim to create public goods that simplify the developer experience for common use cases. Examples include, but are not limited to, solutions for payment, payroll, and merchant receivable finance. |
